    <p>Outside of work, she enjoys drawing and making illustrations for her friends. During quarantine she expressed interest in making her own clothes and created several summer pieces as well as crocheting a few hats. She is a pescetarian but is allergic to fish, which Katrin explains may seem confusing but is actually quite simple. She has recently mastered the art of doing a headstand at will, and once did it while paddle boarding. However, she refuses to show anybody.</p>
