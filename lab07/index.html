        I'm an architecture major interested in participatory design, rehousing homeless populations, and representational methods. I am skilled in a variety of 3D modeling and drafting softwares like AutoCAD, Rhino 3D and SolidWorks, and I've been working with Adobe Suite for over five years. I know basic carpentry, metal working, welding, and 3D printing and I am skilled in hand rendering and urban sketching. My artwork has been shown in exhibitions in both Italy, New York and New Jersey and I have worked as a freelance artist and window painter and have helped work on the exhibition designs for shows in different venues in NYC.
        Outside of work, I enjoy drawing and making illustrations for my friends. During quarantine I've started making different clothing pieces, but mostly watching videos of people making clothes. I am a pescetarian but I am allergic to fish which can be confusing, but is actually quite simple! I've also recently mastered the art of doing a headstand and once did it while paddle boarding. Unfortunately I have not been able to recreate that moment.
